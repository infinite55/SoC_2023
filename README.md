# Hands-on Computational Physics
Seasons of Code-2023, Web and Coding Club, IIT Bombay <br>
Mentors: Varad Mahashabde, Kaustav Prasad

### Overview
The project on Computational Physics started with the implementation of several numerical techniques, such as Euler, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Newton-Raphson, and Secant methods. It progressed with a series of Mini-Projects that involved solving different physics problems using computational approaches. These Mini-Projects covered topics like the finite difference method for the Poisson equation, numerically solving for eigenstates and eigenvalues of the Schr√∂dinger equation for the hydrogen atom, time evolution systems using Runge-Kutta Algorithms, and an open-end project on the Ising Model.
